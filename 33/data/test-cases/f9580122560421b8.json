It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options.\nSolution: Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's \"frame-ancestors\" directive.","flaky":false,"newFailed":false,"newBroken":false,"newPassed":false,"retriesCount":0,"retriesStatusChange":false,"beforeStages":[],"afterStages":[],"labels":[{"name":"parentSuite","value":"OWASP ZAP"},{"name":"suite","value":"Alerts"},{"name":"resultFormat","value":"allure2"}],"parameters":[],"links":[],"hidden":false,"retry":false,"extra":{"severity":"normal","retries":[],"categories":[{"name":"Product defects","matchedStatuses":[],"flaky":false}],"tags":[]},"source":"f9580122560421b8.json","parameterValues":[]}
