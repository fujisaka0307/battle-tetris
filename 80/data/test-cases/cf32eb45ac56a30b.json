If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching\nSolution: Validate that the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information. If it does, consider the use of the following HTTP response headers, to limit, or prevent the content being stored and retrieved from the cache by another user:Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, privatePragma: no-cacheExpires: 0This configuration directs both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 compliant caching servers to not store the response, and to not retrieve the response (without validation) ","flaky":false,"newFailed":false,"newBroken":false,"newPassed":false,"retriesCount":0,"retriesStatusChange":false,"beforeStages":[],"afterStages":[],"labels":[{"name":"parentSuite","value":"OWASP ZAP"},{"name":"suite","value":"Alerts"},{"name":"resultFormat","value":"allure2"}],"parameters":[],"links":[],"hidden":true,"retry":true,"extra":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"source":"cf32eb45ac56a30b.json","parameterValues":[]}
